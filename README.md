The CLI app is a simple calculator that adds, substracts, multiplies or divide two numbers.

The app was created as a homework task for Python Beginning F1. 

The detailde task is below:

"This will not be a usual assignment, as we are not working with Python directly here. 
You will have eight tasks. Complete them one by one, and only in the end, 
submit a link to your repository (explained in Task 8) as the submission for your assignment.

Task 1
Create an empty directory and initialize a git repository in it.

Task 2
Create a file app.py and write a CLI app - a simple calculator: 
it should be able to add and subtract two numbers.

Task 3
Stage and commit your app. Write a meaningful commit message.

Task 4
Now let's create a branch feat-mul. Checkout this branch and 
change the app to support multiplication also. Don't forget to commit your changes.

Task 5
Return to the main branch and create a new branch feat-div. 
Checkout this branch and develop division support for your app. Don't forget to commit your changes.

Task 6
Return to the main branch. Here, you should have a basic version of the app 
that supports only addition and subtraction. With a new commit, 
create a README.md file that contains the user manual for your app.
At this point, your tree of commits should look like this:
 main-> (Readme)      feat-mul->(mul)         feat-div->(div)
           |                      |                       |
           |                      |                       |
           +----------------------+-----------------------+
           |
     (first-commit)

Task 7
Merge it!
Merge all the changes from feat-mul and feat-div separately into main. 
Remove branch feat-mul, but leave feat-div.

Task 8
Create a repository on your personal Github and make it public. 
Push all of your branches to this repository, and as a submission, paste the link in the following cell."
